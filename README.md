# Customer_Intentions_Clustering

## Project Details:

Raw customer data is often times unsuitable for supervised machine learning, because they come in an unlabeled and uncategorized form. Despite this, we can still use these datasets to classify customer categories using clustering techniques. The purpose of this project is to use clustering techniques to classify unsupervised data related to online customer shopping, to label the categories based on how each category differs from the others, and to perform classification on the labelled data using machine learning algorithms.

- **Business Understanding**:
 

Oftentimes we receive a data set that is not yet suited for supervised machine learning because it lacks the necessary target. In these cases, we can sometimes use clustering to extrapolate categories and then use the cluster labels for downstream classification. For this challenge, we'd like to see how you do at this kind of task.

Create a fresh Python project (either `.py` or `.ipynb`) that does the following:
 - [ ] Downloads a clustering data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
 - [ ] Performs clustering on the data. _Note: Please include an explanation of why you selected that particular clustering algorithm for this problem._
 - [ ] Plots the clusters and provides a textual interpretation of the results.
 - [ ] Transforms the cluster labels into target variables for classification.
 - [ ] Performs classification on the data using the new categorical target values. _Note: please include an explanation of why you selected that particular classification algorithm._
 - [ ] Evaluates the performance of the classifier and provides some textual interpretation.
 - [ ] Includes a sketched-out diagram (e.g. using Google draw or on paper/whiteboard) of a pipeline that integrates the above steps so that the model could be rebuilt on demand (e.g. in a production environment).
